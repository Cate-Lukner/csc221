## Vim

So my vim tutorial decided it was going to be in Polish...
All the lesson names match the English version. For example Lekcja 1.2 is the same as Lesson 1.2 as the English version.
No, I did not read all of this in Polish, I just looked up an English version and read that then did the exercises in my version. It might be more convienient to change my laptop into English but I am determined to learn Polish.
