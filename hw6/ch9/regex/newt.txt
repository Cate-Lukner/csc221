Newts share many of the characteristics of their
salamander kin, Caudata, including semipermeable glandular skin, four
equal-sized limbs, and a distinct tail.
The newt's skin, however, is not as smooth
as that of other salamanders. Aquatic larvae
have true teeth on both upper and lower
jaws, and external gills. They have the
ability to regenerate limbs, eyes, spinal cords, hearts,
intestines, and upper and lower jaws.
The Japanese fire belly newt can regenerate its
eye lens 18 times over a period of
16 years and retain its structural and functional
properties. The cells at the site of
the injury have the ability to undifferentiate, reproduce
rapidly, and differentiate again to create a new limb or organ.
One hypothesis is that the undifferentiated cells are
related to tumour cells, since chemicals that produce
tumours in other animals will produce additional limbs in newts.
