# Final Project Proof of Concept

### Description:
Once of my least favorite parts of my math homework is getting to my textbook, going through it, and finding the correct problems. Furthermore, I have slow internet which makes this task even more tedious. Additonally, I often solve the wrong problems since the homework problems are hidden among a mass of others problems. I desperately need my math homework automated for the purpose of my grades and sanity. Plus, I would like to learn more about webscraping and pdfs, since these were the chapters I could not devote as much time as I would have liked. I want to create a program that goes to cengage.com, accesses my textbook, locates the correct problems, takes a screenshot, and saves all the screenshots to a pdf. The program would take two arguments: the section of homework and the problems.   
### Possible Implementation Strategies:

### Relevant Source:
Since my Discrete Mathematics textbook is online and not a pdf, webscraping modules like BeautifulSoup and requests will be crtical for this project. I will also need to long into my account as well, thus the seleium module will also be useful. Depending on how I decide to implement the project, pyautogui may also come into use.
