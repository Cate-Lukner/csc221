# Final Project Proof of Concept
#### Cate Lukner

### Description:
The task I would like to automate is pulling assignments from Canvas, specifically my math assignments. For the first section of the project, I will focus on the Canvas API and learning how to pull assignments down from Canvas. I will also parse out the relevant bits. If time permits, I will go to Cengage.com (where my math textbook is located), and use the information parsed from Canvas to locate the correct section in the Textbook. 
### Possible Implementation Strategies:
The first step will be focus on the Canvas API. I will work with the API to get all my math assignments. I may use JSON to interact with the Canvas API and build the data structure I need. I will use the data structure to parse out the relevant bits for my assignment. If I am able to move onto the workflow of my math homework, I will use Selenium to open a web browser and control it. To go to my textbook, I will use Pyautogui so the correct window will activate and my mouse can click on the textbook. 
### Relevant Sources:
Selenium will be useful for opening and logging into Canvas. A Canvas API on Github will be useful: https://github.com/ucfopen/canvasapi. I will need a data structure to store my Canvas assignments. For this, I will use JSON.
