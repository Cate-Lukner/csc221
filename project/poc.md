# Final Project Proof of Concept

### Description:

### Possible Implementation Strategies:

### Relevant Source:
Since my Discrete Mathematics textbook is online and not a pdf, webscraping modules like BeautifulSoup and requests will be crtical for this project. I will also need to long into my account as well, thus the seleium module will also be useful. Depending on how I decide to implement the project, pyautogui may also come into use.
